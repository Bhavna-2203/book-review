		While being productive ranks high on seemingly every soul's list this quarantine,I still believe(and sincerely hope from the bottom of my heart)that the planet is inhabited by a bunch of gems who look beyond the mundane,possess an uncanny semblance of serendipity and stand by the sheer beauty of doing absolutely nothing.After all,this is a pandemic and not a productivity contest.That being said,one profound source of influence in these times for me has been derived from the book 'Diary of a Young Girl' by Anne Frank.Although I read it way back in tenth grade,it still remains one of those literary works that stay with you and are relevant for years to come.What sets apart this highly nuanced book is that it captures the adolescent musings and frailties in a truly impeccable manner.I don't think that Anne realised that by putting her mere teenage rambles and whims she was leaving behind a great treasure,the treasure of thought.<br>
		The most beautiful aspect of the book is the accuracy with which it portrays human relationships-those with your peers as well as family and goes on to discuss matters of war religion,philosophy and everything under the sun where a human mind can possibly go.It is the relatability of this exceedingly personal account that makes one go and open the same pages again and read them with the same smile you once read it with as a tenth grader in school.Anne's account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and is a compelling self portrait of a spirited young lady with whom I share several commonalities-our interest in the royal family,mythology,tendency to view relationships and our ever-thinking overboard minds!
		Anne is also a dreamer who dwells on the deeply philosophical often igniting controversial issues and finding herself in hilarious sticky spots owing to that.However,one thing is for sure that Anne believes in the inherent beauty of people and life,she believes in magic and is ever hopeful for a better tomorrow when she will encounter better things.History might disagree with me and say that Anne's wish remained unfulfilled for her promise was tragically cut short but for those who know Anne right from the personal pages from her diary would know that she would be laughing her head off seeing those rather  unflattering descriptions of people now reading her book,her incessant chatter almost on the verge of the book being banned in certain areas.Anne's diary is conclusive proof that words have power,they have the power to change and outlive human life,the power to make one's life worth remembering even while one thought one was doing nothing all this time.<br>
		Somewhere in the book,Anne mentions-"What a wonderful thought it is that some of the best days of our life haven't even happened yet" and today I have an after thought as an answer to her,just like she has had so many for me and that is the fact that the best days of your life are not found in number,age or experiences even.They are only a determinant of how much you loved and were loved.Love of any form is the force that makes life worth living and makes your days worth being counted and that Anne,you have truly earned...<br><br><br>
